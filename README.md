## Run the application
I built it using Ganache for auto mining and fast transactions.
`run Ganache node`
`cd research` then `npm start`
## What it does
It is a decentralized application built on the blockchain technology to secure the approvals of research paper written by the students, it gives one complete freedom to submit a research paper and approve it, based on its quality making it a very transparent and secure process.

## How I built it
I have built it using react for the front-end part and used solidity for back-end for the smart-contract of the application. I have made it more robust by pinning the research paper on the **Inter planetary file system** on submitting making it more safe and plagiarism free. 
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I made this for my university, so this feeling in itself is a very proud one, but in technicality what I feel as my accomplishment are :- 
- Nice and simple front-end for submitting research paper and it's approval.
- Successful integration of the smart-contract with the front-end, for hassle free interaction with the application.
- Successfully able to pin and unpin files on the Inter planetary file system from the front-end.
- Personalization through giving access to the authors to delete their research paper in case of any error/updation.
